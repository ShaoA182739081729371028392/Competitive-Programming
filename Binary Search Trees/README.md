This file houses many methods for basic operations on Binary Search Trees, such as deletion, insertion, in order traversal, rank, etc.
While the program itself doesn't have a UI, but it can be used as an import for another algorithm where a Binary Search Tree might optimize the runtime further.
It has clean modularized code, and easy enough documentation to be used.
